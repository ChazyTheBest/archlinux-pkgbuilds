# Deprecated PKGBUILDs

The PKGBUILDs contained in this directory have been deprecated by the slow
weathering of the evolution of Arch itself (systemd-* PKGBUILDs), because
they have been merged with other packages, or because they have been adopted
by TUs.

Do not expect the PKGBUILDs in this repo to persist for any length of time.
They may be removed permanently for any reason.

Those that remain here do so because they serve as useful artifacts or as
substitutes for official packages to a minor degree. I prefer my own systemd
unit file for Redis, for instance, but I keep it in /etc/systemd/system
where user-modified unit files should exist.

If you spot a PKGBUILD that needs to be moved into this directory, please
submit a pull request.
