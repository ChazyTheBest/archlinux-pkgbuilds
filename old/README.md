# Deprecated PKGBUILDs

The PKGBUILDs contained in this directory have been deprecated by the slow
weathering of the evolution of Arch itself (systemd-* PKGBUILDs), because
they have been merged with other packages, because they have been adopted
by TUs, or because I no longer wish to maintain them. In some cases, these
packages were never uploaded to the AUR; others may have been uploaded at
some point in the distant past but never survived the migration to AUR4.

Do not expect the PKGBUILDs in this repo to persist for any length of time.
They may be removed permanently for any reason. In all likelihood, I'll
probably forget about them, and you'll find things that have languished
here for years. If you're particularly bothered that I'm keeping any of
these packages around, submit a ticket (or a pull request), and I'll
remove them (especially if you were the original maintainer/author and I
later adopted one of these packages).

The rest that remain here do so because they serve as useful artifacts or as
substitutes for official packages to a minor degree. I prefer my own systemd
unit file for some services, for instance, but I keep them in
/etc/systemd/system where user-modified unit files should exist. Those units
may eventually appear in my dotfiles collection rather than living on here
where they no longer belong. Those that do will be noted.

If you spot a PKGBUILD that needs to be moved into this directory, please
submit a pull request.
